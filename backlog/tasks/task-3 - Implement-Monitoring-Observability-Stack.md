## Description (the why)

Implement a comprehensive monitoring and observability stack to improve system reliability, performance monitoring, and operational visibility across all services in our infrastructure. This will enable proactive issue detection, faster troubleshooting, and better capacity planning.

## Acceptance Criteria (the what)

- [ ] Prometheus deployed and collecting metrics from all services
- [ ] Grafana dashboards created for key infrastructure and service metrics
- [ ] Loki deployed for log aggregation with Promtail agents on all nodes
- [ ] Tempo deployed for distributed tracing
- [ ] Alertmanager configured with notification channels (email, xmpp, etc.)
- [ ] Basic alerting rules defined for critical system metrics
- [ ] Documentation created for accessing and using the observability tools
- [ ] Runbooks created for common monitoring scenarios

## Implementation Plan (the how)

1. Deploy Prometheus server with persistent storage in Nomad
2. Configure service discovery in Prometheus to automatically discover Nomad jobs
3. Deploy Grafana with pre-configured dashboards
4. Set up Loki for log aggregation and deploy Promtail agents
5. Deploy Tempo for distributed tracing
6. Configure Alertmanager with notification channels
7. Define and implement basic alerting rules
8. Create documentation and runbooks for the new observability stack
9. Train team members on using the new tools
