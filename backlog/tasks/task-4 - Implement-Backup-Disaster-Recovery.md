## Description (the why)

Implement a backup and disaster recovery system to protect against data loss and ensure business continuity. This will provide mechanisms to recover from hardware failures, accidental deletions, security incidents, and other potential disruptions.

## Acceptance Criteria (the what)

- [ ] Automated backup solution deployed for all persistent volumes
- [ ] Database-specific backup procedures implemented for critical services
- [ ] Configuration backup system for Nomad jobs and variables
- [ ] Primary backup storage configured on NFS volume
- [ ] Offsite backup synchronization to S3-compatible storage
- [ ] Backup encryption implemented for data in transit and at rest
- [ ] Retention policies configured (daily/weekly/monthly)
- [ ] Backup monitoring and alerting system implemented
- [ ] Documentation created for backup and recovery procedures
- [ ] Disaster recovery runbooks created and tested

## Implementation Plan (the how)

1. Deploy backup management tooling (e.g., Restic or similar) in Nomad
2. Create backup jobs for all persistent volumes using CSI snapshot capabilities
3. Implement database-specific backup procedures for services that require them
4. Set up configuration backup system for Nomad jobs and variables
5. Configure primary backup storage on NFS volume
6. Implement offsite backup synchronization to S3-compatible storage
7. Configure backup encryption for data in transit and at rest
8. Set up retention policies (daily/weekly/monthly)
9. Implement backup monitoring and alerting system
10. Create documentation for backup and recovery procedures
11. Develop disaster recovery runbooks
12. Conduct initial backup restoration test
